================================================================================
 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

ASAGUS is a software development company website paired with its own custom-built,
self-hosted admin panel. The project is split into two major parts:

  A) MAIN WEBSITE  → Next.js 16 app at the root of the project
                     Runs on port 3000 (dev) / built as production Next.js app
                     Uses static TypeScript data + external API for projects

  B) ADMIN PANEL   → Separate sub-project at /admin-panel/
                     Microservices architecture (4 services + 1 frontend)
                     Runs on ports 4000 (API gateway), 4001, 4002, 4003, 3001

Both parts share one PostgreSQL database (asagus_admin).
The main website currently falls back to a local TypeScript data file
(data/projects.ts) if the backend API is unavailable.

Architecture Type: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces.

Directory Structure Summary:
  /                     → Main website (Next.js)
  /app/                 → Next.js App Router pages & API routes
  /components/          → All frontend UI components (26 components)
  /data/                → Static TypeScript data (projects.ts)
  /lib/                 → Utility libraries (validation, logger, projects-api, scroll)
  /public/              → Static assets
  /admin-panel/         → Entire admin panel (monorepo)
  /admin-panel/frontend/         → Next.js admin UI (port 3001)
  /admin-panel/services/         → 4 Express microservices
  /admin-panel/packages/database/→ Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL schema

 5. BACKEND MICROSERVICES - FULL BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

The admin panel backend consists of 4 Express.js services:

--- A) AUTH SERVICE (Port 4001) ---

Handles all authentication and user management.

Endpoints (/api/v1/auth/...):
  POST /login              → Login with email+password, returns JWT tokens
  POST /register           → Create new user account
  POST /refresh-token      → Refresh access token using refresh token
  POST /logout             → Invalidate refresh tokens
  GET  /me                 → Get current user profile + roles + permissions
  PUT  /me                 → Update name, avatar URL
  PUT  /change-password    → Change password (requires current password)
  POST /forgot-password    → Request password reset (TODO: email not implemented)
  POST /reset-password     → Reset password with token
  POST /verify-email       → Verify email with code

Admin-only user management:
  GET  /users              → List all admin users
  GET  /users/:id          → Get single user
  PUT  /users/:id          → Update user profile
  DELETE /users/:id        → Delete user
  POST /users/:id/roles    → Assign role to user

JWT Details:
  - Access token: 15 minute expiry (configurable)
  - Refresh token: 7 day expiry (configurable)
  - Both stored in localStorage on admin frontend
  - Auto-refresh on 401 (except for auth endpoints to avoid infinite loop)
  - Fully audited: every login, failed login, logout, register → AuditLog

Password Security:
  - bcryptjs hashing
  - Rate limiting at gateway level (200 req/min globally)


--- B) CONTENT SERVICE (Port 4002) ---

Handles all website content management.

Projects (/api/v1/content/projects/...):
  GET    /           → List with filters: category, featured, published, search, sort, pagination

--- C) ANALYTICS SERVICE (Port 4003) ---

Handles page view tracking and analytics reporting.

Public endpoints:
  POST /api/v1/analytics/pageview  → Track a page view (path, referrer, sessionId)
                                     Auto-detects browser + device from User-Agent
  POST /api/v1/analytics/event     → Track custom event (name, category, label, value, metadata)

Protected endpoints (require JWT):
  GET  /api/v1/analytics/overview  → Aggregate stats for admin dashboard
                                     Period: 7d, 30d, 90d
                                     Returns: totalViews, periodViews, uniqueVisitors (approx),
                                              topPages[], deviceBreakdown[], browserBreakdown[],
                                              totalEvents, recentEvents[], dailyViews[]
  GET  /api/v1/analytics/audit-logs → Paginated audit log viewer
                                       Filters: action type, search, pagination


--- D) API GATEWAY (Port 4000) ---

Acts as a reverse proxy for all three backend services.

Routes traffic:
  /api/v1/auth/*     → http://localhost:4001
  /api/v1/content/*  → http://localhost:4002
  /api/v1/analytics/*→ http://localhost:4003
  /api/v1/projects/* → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite from /projects to /content/projects)
  /api/v1/services/* → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)
  /api/v1/testimonials/* → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)
  /api/v1/faqs/*     → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)
  /api/v1/contacts/* → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)
  /api/v1/settings/* → http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)
  /api/v1/dashboard/*→ http://localhost:4002 (with path rewrite)

Security:
  - Helmet.js (security headers)
  - CORS whitelist: localhost:3000, localhost:3001, admin.asagus.com, asagus.com
  - Rate limiting: 200 requests per minute globally
  - Does NOT parse body (avoids consuming request stream for proxy)


================================================================================
 6. API GATEWAY
================================================================================

The gateway (admin-panel/services/api-gateway) is an http-proxy-middleware
based Express app that:

1. Applies security headers via Helmet
2. Applies CORS whitelist
3. Applies global rate limiting (200 req/min)
4. Routes all /api/v1/* requests to the appropriate microservice
5. Provides health check endpoints (/health, /api/v1/health)

Important technical note documented in code:
  The gateway uses pathFilter (not Express mount paths) to avoid stripping
  path prefixes, which would cause upstream 404s. This is a correct,
  intentional design decision.

The admin frontend (Next.js at 3001) has its own proxy configured via
next.config.ts to forward API calls to the gateway at port 4000.


================================================================================
 7. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY SYSTEM
================================================================================

Authentication Flow:
  1. User POSTs email+password to /api/v1/auth/login
  2. Auth service validates credentials, hashes password comparison with bcrypt
  3. Extracts roles[] and permissions[] from DB
  4. Issues: accessToken (JWT, 15min) + refreshToken (JWT, 7d)
  5. refreshToken is ALSO stored in the database (refresh_tokens table)
  6. Frontend stores both in localStorage
  7. All subsequent API calls include Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}
  8. On 401: frontend auto-refreshes using refreshToken
  9. On refresh failure: clears tokens + redirects to /login

Permission System (RBAC):
  - 4 roles: super_admin, admin, editor, viewer
  - Permissions are resource:action pairs
  - Resources: 12 types (projects, services, users, settings, analytics, contacts, etc.)
  - Actions per resource: create, read, update, delete + special actions
  
  Role capabilities:
    super_admin: ALL permissions (no restrictions)
    admin: All EXCEPT system settings, assign_roles, delete users
    editor: Content CRUD (no delete), read analytics, read+update contacts,
            publish projects, export analytics
    viewer: Read-only access to content + analytics + contacts

API Key System:
  - api_keys table exists with key_hash, permissions (JSON), rate_limit
  - Keys are per-user with optional expiry
  - Currently seeded but not fully exposed in the frontend UI

Audit Trail:
  - EVERY action in the auth service writes to audit_logs
  - Captures: userId, action, resource, resourceId, IP, userAgent,
              success/failure, failure reason, metadata
  - Login failures are logged even without a userId (metadata stores attempted email)


================================================================================
 8. SEO, ANALYTICS & TRACKING
================================================================================

Main Website SEO (very comprehensive):

  1. Static metadata in layout.tsx:
     - Full Open Graph implementation
     - Twitter card
     - Language alternates (8 regions)
     - Robots directives

  2. Structured Data (structured-data.tsx):
     - Organization JSON-LD schema
     - Website JSON-LD schema
     - SoftwareApplication JSON-LD schema

  3. GEO Schema (geo-schema.tsx):
     - LocalBusiness schema targeting multiple regions
     - Service area markup

  4. AI Discovery (ai-meta.tsx + citation-guide.tsx + conversational-content.tsx):
     - Special meta tags for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude visibility
     - Citation format guidance
     - Structured Q&A content for AI to pick up

  5. Dynamic sitemaps:
     - /sitemap.xml with all routes
     - /geo-sitemap.xml with language variants
     - /sitemap-images.xml with image data

Google Analytics:
  - components/analytics.tsx has GoogleAnalytics component
  - Tracks page changes via pathname/searchParams hooks
  - Helper functions: trackEvent, trackFormSubmission, trackButtonClick, trackSectionView
  - Requires NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID environment variable to be set
  - Currently NOT added to layout.tsx (component exists but not used/mounted)

Custom Analytics (Admin Panel):
  - Backend analytics service tracks page views and events
  - Auto-detects device (desktop/mobile/tablet) and browser from User-Agent
  - Records IP, session ID, referrer
  - Main website does NOT currently call /api/v1/analytics/pageview
    (the client.ts file exists but tracking calls not added to website pages)


================================================================================
 9. EMAIL & COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Email Provider: Resend (resend.com)
Required env var: RESEND_API_KEY

Contact Form (/api/contact route):
  - Sends styled HTML email to CONTACT_TO_EMAIL (default: mshahwar92@gmail.com)
  - Includes: name, email, phone, service type, message in formatted card
  - HTML injection prevention via escapeHtml()
  - Returns 503 if RESEND_API_KEY not configured

Newsletter (/api/newsletter route):
  - Sends branded welcome email to subscriber
  - Also sends new subscriber notification to TO_EMAIL
  - Includes: design trends, tips, case studies pitch in email
  - Unsubscribe link exists but is a placeholder ("#")

Contact Reply (Admin Panel):
  - Admin can write and save a reply to a contact in the DB
  - The reply is stored in contact_submissions.reply
  - NOTE: Email is NOT sent on reply yet (code has "TODO: Send email reply via Resend")
  - This is an incomplete feature

Live Chat (Crisp):
  - Integration code is complete in live-chat.tsx
  - Requires NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID env var
  - Currently NOT active (no Crisp ID configured)

================================================================================
12. GAPS, ISSUES & INCOMPLETE FEATURES
================================================================================

CRITICAL GAPS:

  1. Contact Form → NOT written to database
     The main website /api/contact sends an email via Resend but does NOT
     write the submission to the contact_submissions database table.
     The admin panel Contacts page relies on that table. Currently the
     contacts you see in the admin are only those manually seeded.
     FIX: The /api/contact route should POST to the admin panel backend
     to also save the submission.

  2. Live Chat NOT Configured
     Crisp widget code is complete but NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID is not set.
     No live chat is active on the website.

  3. Dead Navigation Links
     FloatingNavbar has "Research" (→ /research-development) and "Products"
     (→ /products) links. NEITHER page exists → 404 error for visitors.

  4. Google Analytics NOT Mounted
     analytics.tsx component exists but is never imported in layout.tsx.
     No GA tracking is happening.

  5. Custom Analytics Tracking NOT Called from Main Website
     The admin panel has an analytics microservice that tracks pageviews,
     but the main website never calls /api/v1/analytics/pageview.
     So page view data in the admin analytics is always 0 unless called externally.

  6. Contact Reply Email NOT Sent
     Admin can type a reply and it's saved to DB, but the email is never
     sent. Code has "TODO: Send email reply via Resend" comment.

  7. Forgot Password Email Flow Incomplete
     Backend endpoint exists at /api/v1/auth/forgot-password but the
     email sending step is not implemented (no Resend call).

  8. Main Website Projects vs Admin Panel Projects
     The main website and admin panel both have project data but use
     different sources. The website uses lib/projects-api.ts which queries
     the admin backend, but falls back to data/projects.ts when API is
     offline. If the admin panel is not running, website shows static data.

MISSING UI PAGES in Admin:
  - No Media Library management page (DB model + upload components exist)
  - No Client Logos page (DB model exists)
  - No Stats/Counters management page (DB model exists)
  - No Newsletter Subscribers page (model exists, list/export UI missing)
  - No Blog Categories management (model exists)
  - No API Keys management page (model exists)

MISSING FEATURES:
  - No email tracking / click tracking in newsletters
  - No "Export to CSV" for contacts or subscribers
  - No bulk actions in any list view (bulk delete, bulk publish)
  - No drag-and-drop reorder (FAQs have up/down arrows, others have sort order number field only)
  - No image optimization/compression on upload
  - No country/city tracking in analytics (fields exist in schema but not populated)
  - No session tracking (session_id field in DB but not used from main website)
  - No real-time dashboard (stats are fetched on page load only)
  - No notifications/alerts system for new contacts
  - Redis is configured in .env but NOT used anywhere in the microservices

SECURITY NOTES:
  - The .env file has plain text credentials including DB password and JWT secrets
  - JWT secrets are not very strong ("asagus-admin-access-secret-2026-min-32-characters-required")
    → should use randomly generated secrets in production
  - Social media links in footer are all placeholder URLs (linkedin.com, instagram.com)
    → not pointing to actual ASAGUS accounts
  - SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env is simple enough to note → should be changed in prod


================================================================================
13. POTENTIAL ADDITIONS & IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Complete Missing Features):

  1. Connect Contact Form to Database
     → Modify app/api/contact/route.ts to also POST to the admin panel
       /api/v1/content/contacts endpoint so contacts show in admin.

     → Add a useEffect in layout.tsx or a client component to call
       /api/v1/analytics/pageview on each page navigation.

  5. Create Missing Pages
     → /research-development → Could show research_projects (is_public ones)
     → /products → Products/SaaS page showcasing own tools

  6. Wire Up Crisp Live Chat
     → Register at crisp.chat, get website ID, add to env var.

WHAT THE ADMIN PANEL CAN CONTROL ON THE MAIN WEBSITE:
(These only work if the main website reads from the API, not static data)

  • Which projects appear on the website (published = true/false)
  • Project order (order_index)
  • Project featured status (shows in featured section)
  • All project details: images, descriptions, tech stack, links

  • Which services are shown and in what order
  • Service icons and feature lists

  • FAQs content and order

  • Testimonials displayed and their order

  • Blog posts (if a blog page is added to the website)

  • Team page content (if a team page is added)

  • Research projects (if a research page is added)

  • Website-wide settings (title, description, social links, etc.)

NOTE: Most of the above content control is READY in the backend
but the main website STILL uses static/fallback data for most things.
Connecting them requires minimal work.


================================================================================
15. FINAL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

OVERALL QUALITY: HIGH

The ASAGUS project is a professionally crafted, production-oriented application.
The code quality is clean, well-structured, and follows modern patterns throughout.

STRENGTHS:
  ✅ Very clean and professional UI/UX on both main website and admin panel
  ✅ Excellent microservices architecture with a proper API gateway
  ✅ Full role-based access control (RBAC) system with granular permissions
  ✅ Complete audit logging system - enterprise-grade traceability
  ✅ Comprehensive database schema covering all business needs
  ✅ World-class SEO implementation (structured data, geo-targeting, AI discovery)
  ✅ Strong security patterns (bcrypt, JWT rotation, rate limiting, helmet)
  ✅ Well-organized monorepo with pnpm workspaces
  ✅ Responsive designs for both desktop and mobile
  ✅ Rich text editing, image uploads, technology selectors in admin
  ✅ Multiple content types (blog, research, projects, team, services)
  ✅ Docker support for easy local setup

AREAS NEEDING ATTENTION:
  ⚠️  Contact form submissions are NOT saved to the database
  ⚠️  Main website still uses static data files (not pulled from admin database)
  ⚠️  Several navigation links lead to non-existent pages (404)
  ⚠️  Analytics tracking not wired up to main website
  ⚠️  Several admin panel sections lack corresponding frontend pages
  ⚠️  Default credentials should be rotated before production deployment
  ⚠️  Redis is configured but completely unused (wasted resource)

COMPARED TO A TYPICAL PORTFOLIO/COMPANY SITE:
  This is approximately 3x more sophisticated. It has a full CMS built from scratch,
  microservices backend, enterprise auth, plus one of the most comprehensive SEO
  setups seen in a company website of this size.

ESTIMATED COMPLETION:
  Core Admin Panel:     ~85% complete (missing few pages)
  Main Website:         ~75% complete (some features not wired to backend)
  Data Integration:     ~40% complete (most data still hardcoded or static)
  Email System:         ~60% complete (one-way emails work, replies do not)
  Analytics:            ~50% complete (service exists, tracking not called)

THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY:
  The backend and admin panel already support all the content types needed.
  The main gap is connecting the main website to dynamically read everything
  from the admin panel database instead of static TypeScript files.
  Once that bridge is built, the admin panel becomes a full CMS that controls
  every aspect of what visitors see on asagus.com.
